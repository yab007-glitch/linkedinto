      "title": "The best deals on MacBooks right now",
      "description": "The 15-inch MacBook Air offers better speakers than its 13-inch sibling, but is otherwise similar.\t\n\nApple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series processors in a wide range of sizes and price points, all of which run the company’s newest operating system, macOS 26. Purchasing a new MacBook can be complicated if you’re trying to figure out what specs you need, but finding a deal on a relatively speedy model is surprisingly easy, especially since Apple increased the starting RAM on several models in late 2024.\n\n\nThese days, it’s not uncommon to see various MacBooks discounted by up to $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain configurations of older models as Apple continues to move forward with newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store offers a one-year warranty and generally discounts new units by up to 20 percent.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM4 MacBook Air\nIn March, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with an M4 processor. Interestingly, the latest Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a fresh sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. Needless to say, there’s a lot to like.\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some sizable discounts, too. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, an eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale at Amazon and Best Buy for around $799 ($200 off), which is just $50 shy of its lowest price to date. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for about $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which remains its second-best price to date.\n13-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $999 $799.99 at Amazon\n $999 $799 at Best Buy\n $999 $889 at B&H Photo\n\n\n15-inch MacBook Air (M4, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1199 $999.99 at Amazon\n $1199 $1099 at B&H Photo\n $1199 $999 at Best Buy\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nIn November 2024, Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new in this model is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View, as well as the optional nano-texture display option.\nMany variations of the M4 MacBook Pro with different screen and processor configurations are on sale right now. For example, the 14-inch M4 Pro with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is available for $1,299 ($300 off) at B&H Photo. You can also pick up the 14-inch Pro with 24GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) at Amazon and Best Buy for $1,749 ($250 off), which is a solid discount even if it’s not the biggest price drop we’ve seen in recent months.\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for around $2,249 ($250 off), which is $120 more than the all-time low we saw during Black Friday.\nApple MacBook Pro 14 (2024, M4)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1299 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\n14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $1749 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1999 $1999 at Adorama (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\n\nApple MacBook Pro 16 (2024, M4 Pro)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2499 $2249.99 at Amazon (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $2499 $2249 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nM5 MacBook Pro\nApple’s latest revision of the 14.2-inch MacBook Pro adds the M5 processor. The generational leap will be felt most by those who have an older MacBook Pro, not those upgrading from the M4, unless you use specific AI apps that tap into the chip’s new Neural Accelerators. As for other design changes and upgrades to the inside and outside of this MacBook Pro, there really aren’t any major ones to note; in fact, it’s so similar to the M4 model that our reviewer Antonio Di Benedetto had to write “M5” on a sticky note just to be able to tell them apart. That being said, it’s still an amazing laptop, one that’s just now starting to get minor discounts.\nThe 14.2-inch base model with the M5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 shy of its best price to date.\nMacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $1599 $1449 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1599 $1449 at Best Buy (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n $1599 $1449 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThe newest Mac Minis in town are the M4-based models, which arrived in late 2024. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the base Mac Mini drop to as low as $469, but right now it’s only on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $499 ($100 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $689 ($110 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo. Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,269 ($130 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\nApple Mac Mini (M4)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 $499 at B&H Photo (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $599 $499 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 256GB SSD)\n $799 $689 at Amazon (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nUpdate, January 16th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.",

      "title": "The LG C5 and Apple’s M4 Mac Mini are both steeply discounted this weekend",
      "description": "Small footprint. Speedy performance. | Image: The Verge\t\n\nHappy Saturday, folks! This week, Best Buy kicked off its so-called “Winter Sale,” introducing a whole host of price cuts that range from not-so-good to legitimately great, at least for this time of year. We’ll be publishing many of the highlights in a dedicated news post tomorrow, though, per usual, not all of this week’s best deals revolve around Best Buy. Apple’s M4 Mac Mini, for instance, is receiving a $100 discount at Amazon and B&H Photo, while LG’s 65-inch C5 OLED TV is on sale at eBay for a little over a grand. There are also steep savings to be had on 45W power banks, the Beats Fit Pro, and more, so let’s dive in. \nMac Mini with M4\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $599 $499 at Amazon (256GB)\n $599 $499 at B&H Photo (256GB)\n $799 $689 at Amazon (512GB)\n\nIf you want a Mac and your budget is less than $500, your only real option — aside from going the refurbished route or picking up a model that’s several generations old — is Apple’s latest Mac Mini. Thankfully, the desktop machine makes for a truly excellent daily driver, one that’s currently on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $499 ($100), which is just $20 shy of its Black Friday low and about $30 less than its best price to date.\nFor most people, the 2024 Mac Mini is a far better (and more economical) choice than the latest Mac Studio. The tiny, M4-powered machine is an excellent value, even at full price, with three Thunderbolt 4 (USB 4) ports, a gigabit ethernet jack, a 3.5mm audio input, and an HDMI port. Its 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU provide fast, consistent performance for a wide range of tasks; however, keep in mind that you’ll need to bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse.\nRead our full Mac Mini (2024) review.\nIniu Carry P51L-E2 Power Bank 45W 20000mAh\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $36.99 $18.86 at Amazon (at checkout)\n\nLast year, we saw a spate of power bank recalls, including those from both Anker and ESR. I replaced one of my aging Anker models during that time with Iniu’s excellent Carry P51L-E2, which is on sale at Amazon for a new low of $18.86 (about $21 off) at checkout.\nThe 20,000mAh power bank isn’t particularly fancy, though it does output up to 45W of power and features a built-in, braided USB-C cable that doubles as a lanyard. You also get an extra USB-C and USB-A port, allowing you to juice your phone, tablet, a pair of wireless earbuds, and other small electronics at the same time. Now, if only Iniu could have packed the extra battery capacity into a charger as compact and colorful as the like-minded Pocket Rocket P50. C’est la vie.\nLG C5 OLED TV (65-inch)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2699.99 $1197.59 at eBay (with code FAVEFINDS20)\n\nArguably the best TV deal you can find this weekend would be on the 65-inch Bravia 8 II, which is still hovering around $2,398 (over $1,000 off) at multiple retailers, including Amazon. But not everyone has that kind of money to throw around on an OLED panel, which makes the current discount on LG’s C5 more appealing. Now through January 20th, you can pick up LG’s 65-inch OLED TV at eBay for $1,197.59 ($1,502 off) when you use code FAVEFINDS20 at checkout.\nLike prior models in the C Series, the C5 is all about value. The 4K set delivers the deep black levels and contrast for which OLEDs are known, and it features LG’s AI Picture Pro, which analyzes what you’re watching and adjusts brightness, resolution, and other settings to improve clarity. It also features a bevy of gaming-friendly features, including a 120Hz refresh rate, support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and four HDMI 2.1 ports, allowing you to play current-gen titles in 4K at up to 120fps. It’s rounded out with HDR10 and Dolby Vision support, further enhancing color and contrast.\nBeats Fit Pro\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $199.95 $89.99 at Woot\n\nHaving now used both the Beats Fit Pro and the new Powerbeats Fit as part of my weekly workout regimen, I can tell you with absolute certainty that there’s little difference between the two — well, other than the fact that the Powerbeats Fit retail for $199.95 and the last-gen Beats Fit Pro are on sale at Woot in select colors for $89.99 ($110 off) through January 31st. Beats’ latest workout earbuds also feature a smaller charging case and more flexible wing tips, I guess, but with the Fit Pro, you’re still getting solid noise cancellation, good sound, and all the Apple ecosystem tricks you’d expect for less than half the price.\nRead our full Beats Fit Pro review.\nMore ways to save this weekend\nElgato’s Stream Deck Plus is matching its all-time low at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, where you can pick it up for $159.99 ($40 off) for a limited time. Like the standard Stream Deck, the Plus model comes with a slew of large, programmable LCD keys — eight, in this case — which you can use to automate a variety of tasks on your computer or control various smart home devices. The Plus comes with a few neat add-ons, though, specifically four knobs for making finer adjustments and a narrow touchscreen at the bottom for viewing tidbits of information at a glance. Read our review.\nIf you’re a modern gamer with a soft spot for the Sega Genesis, 8BitDo’s M30 Bluetooth Controller is down to an all-time low of $20.98 ($4 off) at Amazon as part of an ongoing lightning deal. The inexpensive, retro-styled gamepad sports a similar layout to Sega’s iconic controller, only it comes with Bluetooth, 20 hours of battery life, and built-in buttons for quick access to the homescreen and snapping screenshots. It also works with a handful of platforms, including the Nintendo Switch, Windows, Mac, and Android.\nSpeaking of gaming, Steam’s weeklong Detective Fest is set to wind down at 1PM ET on Monday, January 19th. That means that this weekend is one of your last chances to pick up a copy of The Case of the Golden Idol ($8.99), Disco Elysium ($9.99), The Séance of Blake Manor ($14.99), Strange Horticulture ($6.39), or 2025 GOTY contender, Blue Prince ($19.79), at a steep discount.",

Edge of Tomorrow wasn't a one-to-one translation of All You Need Is Kill's original story or its manga adaptation by Takeshi Obata, Ryosuke Takeuchi, and Yoshitoshi Abe. The movie was more militaristic and focused on humanity rallying against an alien invasion.\nBut Edge of Tomorrow understood that what made its source material so powerful was its imaginative exploration of what it means to be tenaci …\nRead the full story at The Verge.",

      "description": "Sony’s terrific Bravia 8 II is $900 off for a limited time.\t\n\nGood deals are often hard to come by at the beginning of the year — which is precisely what makes Best Buy’s Winter Sale worth checking out. The ongoing sales event features discounts on everything from big-ticket OLED TVs to smaller electronics, including fitness trackers that can help you achieve your New Year’s resolutions. There are also solid deals to be had on laptops, Bose headphones, and other Verge-approved pieces of tech, many of which are matching their best prices to date.\nThe sale ends on January 19th, meaning you have the rest of the weekend to shop. Below, we’ve rounded up the deals — both big and small — that are genuinely worth your attention.\nLG B5 OLED TV\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $2999.99 $1499.99 at Best Buy (77-inch)\n\nIf you’re after a big-screen OLED, LG’s entry-level B5 Series TV remains one of the most affordable options available. And right now, it’s an even better value at Best Buy, where it has fallen to a new low of $1,499.99 ($1,500 off) in the larger 77-inch configuration.\nAlthough it’s considered one of LG’s budget TVs and doesn’t get as bright as its pricier siblings, the B4 still delivers impressive image quality. You get rich colors, deep blacks, and great viewing angles, along with support for Dolby Vision. It supports Dolby Atmos, too, along with a solid set of gaming specs, including a 120Hz panel with a variable refresh rate, support for AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync, and four HDMI 2.1 ports for connecting the latest consoles. It runs on LG’s webOS platform as well, which lets you take advantage of Amazon Alexa and provides easy access to popular streaming apps like Netflix, HBO Max, and more.\nSony Bravia 8 II OLED TV\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $3299.99 $2398 at Amazon (65-inch)\n $3299.99 $2399.99 at Best Buy (65-inch)\n $3299.99 $2399.99 at Sony (65-inch)\n\nSony’s Bravia 8 II is also worth a look if you’re okay with splurging on a high-end TV. Named “King of TV” at the Value Electronics’ 2025 TV Shootout, Sony’s Bravia 8 II delivers one of the closest theater-level experiences you can get at home. And right now, you can buy the 65-inch panel for around $2,399.99 ($900 off) from Best Buy, Amazon, and directly from Sony, which is one of its better prices to date.\nJohn Higgins, The Verge’s new(ish) TV reviewer, said that if he had to buy a TV today, this is the one he’d choose. It delivers deep blacks, excellent shadow detail, and some of the best image processing and upscaling we’ve seen, making lower-quality 1080p content look noticeably cleaner than on rivals. The Bravia 8 II also runs Google TV, which feels more intuitive and less cluttered than LG’s webOS, and features a 120Hz panel with two HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K gaming at 120Hz, plus two HDMI 2.0 ports capped at 4K / 60Hz. It doesn’t support Nvidia G-Sync or AMD FreeSync Premium, but for watching movies and TV shows, it’s one of the best OLEDs you can buy.  \nRead our full Sony Bravia 8 II review.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones\nBose’s first-gen flagships are a replacement for the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 that offer a more travel-friendly design, spatial audio, better call quality, excellent comfort, and some of the best noise cancellation around.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $429 $279 at Best Buy\n $429 $279 at Bose\n\nIf you’re looking for an excellent pair of noise-canceling headphones that are easy to take on the go, Bose’s first-gen QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are on sale in select colors for $279 ($150 off) at Best Buy, matching their all-time low. Bose is also offering the over-ear headphones at that price, though, again, only in select colors.\nThe original QC Ultra remain our favorite pair for travel, thanks to a foldable design that makes them easy to pack, a lightweight and comfortable fit, and battery life that lasts up to 24 hours. They also deliver top-tier ANC and pleasing sound, with an Immersive Audio feature that isn’t always consistent but works well when it does. Plus, you get a natural-sounding transparency mode for when you want to let outside sound in. If you’re fine skipping newer upgrades found in the second-gen model, such as support for lossless audio over USB, the first-gen pair are a great value — especially since they’re currently about $100 cheaper.\nRead our full QC Ultra Headphones review.\nAmazfit Active 2\nThe Amazfit Active 2 delivers outsized value for the price. It looks spiffy and has a wide array of health tracking features, plus built-in GPS and AI chatbots to provide extra context to your data. Read our review.\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $99.99 $84.99 at Amazon\n $99.99 $84.99 at Best Buy\n $99.99 $84.99 at Target\n\nIf you’re looking for a great all-around fitness tracker, the Amazfit Active 2 is still available for $84.99 ($15 off) at Best Buy, Amazon, and Target, which is just $5 shy of its lowest price to date. \nThe Active 2, which is currently our favorite fitness tracker, delivers far more than you’d expect at this price. It features a comfortable design with a chic stainless steel case and a bright, tempered-glass OLED display, along with up to nine days of battery life. It covers all the basics and then some, too, allowing you to leverage more premium features like menstrual cycle tracking, abnormal heart rate notifications, continuous heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and detailed sleep tracking. You also get support for more than 160 sport types, including a strength training mode that counts reps for you, as well as offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation.\nRead our full Amazfit Active 2 review.\nBose SoundLink Micro Portable Speaker (2nd Gen)\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $129 $99 at Amazon\n $129 $99 at Walmart\n $129 $99 at Bose\n\nSpeaking of Bose, Best Buy is also currently selling the latest Bose SoundLink Micro for a new low of $99 ($30 off), with retailers like Amazon and Walmart matching said price.\nBose’s pocketable Bluetooth speaker delivers solid sound for its size and even lets you adjust EQ through a companion app, unlike the first-gen model. It also offers up to 12 hours of battery life, recharges quickly via USB-C, and is surprisingly rugged thanks to an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. A built-in strap lets you easily attach it to a bag or bike, too, and if you already own a compatible Bose speaker or soundbar, you can pair the two together — or link a second-gen SoundLink Micro for stereo sound.\nA few more ways to save\nYou can buy Apple’s latest MagSafe Charger for $29.99 ($20 off) at Best Buy, which matches its lowest price to date. The 2-meter, magnetic charging puck can provide up to 25W of power when paired with a 30W USB-C adapter, assuming you have a compatible phone like the iPhone 17 or 17 Pro. It can also deliver the same wireless speeds to non-Apple phones that support the newer Q2.2 standard, like Google’s Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nBest Buy is selling the Shokz OpenFit 2 Plus in blue for $149.95, which is $10 shy of their lowest price to date. The wireless earbuds are nearly identical to the Shokz OpenFit 2 — they feature the same open-ear design, onboard controls, and dedicated bass speakers — only they add wireless charging and support for Dolby Audio.\nSamsung’s 128GB Galaxy S25 FE is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Samsung for around $448.99 ($200 off), which is a new low price. The budget-friendly Android phone is nearly as slim as the Galaxy S25 Plus and carries the same IP68 rating for water and dust resistance; however, its triple rear camera setup isn’t as impressive as what you’ll find on Samsung’s higher-end models, even if it is decent. That said, you do get support for wireless charging and a large, 6.7-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate.\nAmazon and Best Buy are selling the latest 13-inch MacBook Air for $799.99 ($200 off), which is $50 shy of its best price to date. Apple’s entry-level Air is our top pick for most people, one outfitted with a speedy M4 chip that makes it well-suited for a host of everyday tasks. It’s better for multitasking than prior models, too, as it lets you connect two external displays with the lid open. It also features a 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with a wider view, while continuing to deliver all-day battery life. Read our review.\nYou can pick up the Polaroid Flip, our favorite retro instant camera, for $199.99 ($20 off) at Best Buy, which is one of its better prices to date. The instant camera delivers a nostalgic, old-school shooting experience, producing dreamy, vintage-style photos that are sharper and more consistently in focus than what you’ll get from other similarly priced Polaroid cameras. It also offers a few modern touches, including Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a companion app that lets you tweak settings like exposure.",

Korg has finally given it the attention it deserves with the release of the Kaoss Pad V. Rather than a dramatic reimagining of what a Kaoss Pad is, the V takes the core idea - an effect unit with an X / Y pad for controlling parameters in a natural, performance-focused way.\nThe big innovation on the Kaoss Pad V is that it can recognize two fingers simultaneously to control two distinct sets of parameters, or even two entirely different effects.
