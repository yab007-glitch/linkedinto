      "title": "The best instant cameras you can buy right now",
      "description": "Even with the ability to take excellent photos with our phones and instantly share them across the world, there’s something magical about the old-school instant camera. With just a click of a button, you can capture a moment in a photo that you can see and touch almost immediately. Images captured by an instant camera aren’t as pristine or perfect as those produced by modern digital cameras, but their soft images and imperfections are often a big part of the allure.\nYet not all instant cameras are the same, and some of them are better suited for different needs and budgets. That’s why we tested some of the most popular instant cameras on the market from brands like Fujifilm, Polaroid, Leica, Canon, Kodak, and others.\nAll the models featured in our instant camera buying guide are enjoyable to use, but each offers a distinct set of features at a different price point. As a result, some are more appropriate for a child or budding photographer, while others are more advanced and provide added creative control (for a price). When it comes down to it, though, we consider print quality, ease of use, and affordability to be the hallmarks of a quality shooter. That’s why we picked Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12 as the best instant camera for most people, as it ticks all three boxes wonderfully.\nIf you’re looking for more creative control or features like filters, however, the Instax Mini Evo is our choice, one that boasts great image quality and allows you to choose which photos you’d like to print. Other instant cameras, like Kodak’s Mini Retro 3, also offer a variety of advanced creative modes for those who desire more.\nTake a look at this list of our instant camera recommendations to find the best fit for you.\nThe best instant camera for most people\nFujifilm Instax Mini 12\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nProduces relatively true-to-life photos\nTerrific ease of use\nVery affordable\n\nInstax film can get pricey\nMinimal creative control\nFlash can be overpowering\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $93.95 $83.7 at Amazon\n $93.95 $93 at Walmart\n $93.99 at Best Buy\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 306 grams / Charging method: AA batteries / Companion app: None / Other features: Built-in selfie mirror, film counter\nIf all you’re looking to do is just click a button and get a decent print for a reasonable price, we recommend Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12. It’s a basic instant camera that’s similar to our former pick, the Instax Mini 11, but with some minor updates. It still takes less than five minutes to start shooting, but the setup process is easier since all you need to do is twist the lens to either “on” or “off.” Such ease of use, combined with the camera’s thinner build, makes it particularly well suited for kids and those new to photography.\nFor an instant camera, image quality is also better than most of the other cameras I tested, producing relatively true-to-life photos. Most of the cameras I tested struggled to capture low-light conditions well, and this one is no exception, but the built-in flash does help. Fujifilm claims the Mini 12 optimizes image quality in both dark and bright environments better than its predecessor, but I didn’t notice much of a difference. The flash — which you can’t disable — is also still overpowering in some instances, resulting in a few overexposed images. If anything, the photos actually seemed a little darker and less vivid than before.\nHowever, at least the Instax Mini 12 captured my features and skin color more accurately when I used the included selfie feature — which is really just a small mirror mounted on the front of the camera.\nYou can also zoom in a little more easily thanks to a new lens structure, which you can twist to enter Close-Up Mode instead of pressing a button. When in this mode, you can take advantage of the camera’s new “Parallax Correction” feature, which is supposed to result in a more aligned photo. The lens was fun to play with and reminded me of a traditional point-and-shoot, but actually using it to take quality photos takes some time to figure out. As with the Mini 11, it’s still somewhat tricky to center your subject in the frame using this mode, even with the updated lens. Thankfully, it became easier to properly align photos after a couple of attempts (as well as some composition guidance from the manual).\nThe Mini 12 also offers a number of other niceties. I appreciated the larger-than-average viewfinder and the fact that the camera comes with a small counter that displays the remaining number of shots, which is a feature many of the other instant cameras I tested lacked. It’s easy to lose track of how many photos you’ve taken, especially when out for drinks or while sightseeing on vacation. Yet given each print costs about $1, it’s important to be mindful of how many shots you’ve got left.\nAll in all, the Instax Mini 12 is a basic camera that caters to all ages and experience levels and gets the job done — and done relatively well. It doesn’t feature Bluetooth or pair with a companion app that allows you to edit photos (only scan them), and it doesn’t offer advanced features like filters, lens options, or portrait modes. But if you’re looking for an instant camera that offers a great traditional analog experience, this is it.\nThe best premium instant camera\nFujifilm Instax Mini Evo\n\n\nScore: 8\n\nProsCons\n\n\nGreat use of dials and buttons\nLots of printing flexibility\nGood battery life\n\nInternal storage is limited\nMicro USB port is annoying\nNo viewfinder\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $234 at Amazon\n $234 at Walmart\n $234.99 at Best Buy\n\nFilm type: Fujifilm Instax Mini film (sold separately) / Film size: 2 x 3-inches / Weight: 285 grams / Charging method: USB-C (on newer models) / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\nOne of Fujifilm’s Instax Mini Evo was a favorite of my former colleague Becca Farcase — and it’s mine as well. A hybrid camera that bears a resemblance to Fujifilm’s more expensive Fujifilm X100 line of cameras, it looks good and boasts vintage dials and buttons so stylish that they even caught the attention of passersby as I walked around Los Angeles taking photos. I tested the black camera, but Fujifilm also sells a handsome brown version, as well as a newer pink model.\nIt’s easy to balk at its price tag, but this camera offers a level of flexibility that could save you money in the long run if you use it a lot. That’s because the Instax Mini Evo includes a full-color three-inch LCD screen that lets you preview and select which images you want to print, which can help you avoid wasting film on unwanted shots. The added flexibility gave me more room for creative experimentation, too, as I wasn’t worried about running out of film. I also loved using the Instax Mini Evo app to print photos from my smartphone. Plus, unlike the Instax Mini 12, the Evo now uses a USB-C port (though older black models still use the Micro USB port) for charging, so you don’t need to keep buying new batteries.\nUnlike Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 12, the Mini Evo comes with a few extra features that can help you capture better photos. For example, you can actually turn off the flash on the Mini Evo and use the three-inch LCD screen as a viewfinder. You can also use the menu to adjust how bright you want the film to look when it’s printed, which was helpful given that neither the Evo nor the Mini 12 is particularly good at capturing dark environments.\nAdditionally, there are dials you can use to apply various lens options and filters, ranging from retro to monochrome shades, as well as a mirror lens, vignette, soft focus, and more. You can take app-based remote shots, too, which adds an extra element of photographic control that can help you take better selfie shots than the selfie mirror in the front.\nOf course, it’s not a perfect device, and there are some downsides to consider outside the price. For instance, although you can add filters and make a few edits using Fujifilm’s companion app, it just isn’t as feature-rich as some of the apps for the other digital and hybrid instant cameras I tested. The Evo’s extensive menu system isn’t particularly easy to navigate, either, and it took me some time to figure out how to turn the flash on and off. Plus, if you rely solely on internal storage, you can only store 45 images before the device is full. Still, all of these are minor issues, and I was very happy overall with how portable the stylish camera is, as well as how easy it is to take good photos quickly.\nRead our full Fujifilm Instax Mini Evo review.\nThe best instant camera for social occasions\nKodak Mini Shot 3 Retro\n\n\nScore: 6\n\nProsCons\n\n\nLets you print photos from your phone\nEntertaining companion app\nComes with film\n\nSo-so image quality \nUnable to store images\nNot as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $169.99 $154.99 at Walmart (with eight sheets)\n $169.99 $154.99 at Amazon (with eight sheets)\n $169.99 $159.99 at Kodak (with eight sheets)\n\nFilm type: Kodak Instant Print 3 x 3-inch cartridge (included) / Film size: 3 x 3-inch square prints / Weight: 467 grams / Charging method: Micro USB / Companion app: Yes / Other features: LCD screen, smartphone printing\nWhereas the Instax Mini Evo’s companion app is more functional, Kodak’s hybrid Mini Shot 3 Retro is all about fun. The camera’s accompanying mobile app lets you apply frames, stickers, filters, and a wide range of customization options to photos, making it great for scrapbooking. There’s even a beauty feature in the app to conceal blemishes, as well as a set of Snapchat-like filters you can use to add, say, dog ears, making it a fun instant camera to use as a mini photo booth of sorts at parties.\nLike the Instax Mini Evo, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro comes with an LCD screen — albeit a much smaller one — that lets you decide whether to print a shot. It also supports Bluetooth, and you can use the Kodak Photo Printer app to upload photos to social media or print decent, relatively crisp photos from your smartphone. Unlike the Mini Evo, however, Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro retails for around $170 and includes a pack of film (it’s also often on sale for a lot less). It also uses cheaper film; you can often pick up a 60-sheet cartridge for about $17.99, which equates to roughly $0.33 a shot. The fact that the film is cheaper arguably encourages play and creative experimentation, even if the large 3 x 3-inch square prints feel lower in quality and more flimsy than those from both Fujifilm and Polaroid.\nHowever, there are notable drawbacks to the Kodak Mini Shot 3. My biggest issue is that the resulting prints of photos taken with the camera aren’t nearly as crisp or clear as those taken with a smartphone. Photo quality wasn’t consistently as good as the Mini Evo’s or Mini 12’s, nor, for the most part, as clear and sharp. The photos also sometimes had an excessive pink tint, which can affect quality. It doesn’t store images the way the Mini Evo does, either, which means you can’t decide whether you’d like to print them later. It’s also noticeably heavier than the Mini Evo and, frankly, nowhere near as stylish.\nNonetheless, if you don’t mind compromising on photo quality and want a relatively affordable hybrid camera with fun app features, the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Retro is a good choice.\nThe best instant camera for retro fans\nPolaroid Flip\nThe Polaroid Flip is a great instant camera for retro fans that prints vintage-style photos and offers modern conveniences like USB-C. It also features a variety of creative modes via the companion app, making it a solid choice for artistic photography as well. \n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nAttractive, retro design\nPrints dreamy, vintage-style photos that are relatively sharp for a Polaroid photo\nSeveral creative modes\nUSB-C\n\n\nStruggles in low light\nFilm takes up to 15 minutes to develop\nBulky and relatively heavy\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $219.99 $199.99 at Amazon\n $219.99 at Polaroid\n $219.99 $199.99 at Best Buy\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 4.2 x 3.5-inch prints / Weight: 648 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: Yes / Other features: Flip-up lid, scene analysis feature\nIf you’re looking for an instant camera that offers the most old-fashioned, instant-film experience, the Polaroid Flip is the camera for you. It resembles vintage instant cameras like the Polaroid 600 more than any other camera on our list, thanks to its classic, retro-inspired design and flip-up lid. Its square I-Type film prints and iconic white frame give photos an authentically vintage look, while modern touches like Bluetooth, USB-C charging, and a beginner-friendly companion app add greater convenience and creative control.\nCompared to the third-gen Polaroid Now Plus, my former retro pick, the Flip delivers clearer shots with fewer wasted photos, making the extra $50 worthwhile given that eight I-Type sheets are a spendy $18.99. The increased clarity can be attributed to several factors, including the Flip’s sonar autofocus and a four-lens hyperfocal system — which result in sharper, more focused images — along with its excellent flash. It’s the most powerful of any Polaroid camera, and while it can sometimes overexpose images, you can adjust exposure directly from the camera or app. The Scene Analysis feature also helps by warning if a shot is likely to be over- or underexposed, or if you’re too close to your subject. In my experience, the warnings didn’t always prevent overexposure, but they did leave me with shots that looked less blown than those from the Now Plus.\nIf there’s one thing the Polaroid Flip isn’t known for, it’s portability. Given it’s relatively heavy and awkwardly sized, it’s not the kind of instant camera you can easily slip into your purse or carry around. Additionally, it takes up to 15 minutes for prints to develop, and you must ensure they’re not exposed to light during this process. That’s quite an inconvenience if you’re out with friends, say, at the beach on a sunny day. \nLow-light performance is another weak spot. Although it does a better job than the Now Plus, I still struggled to capture crisp indoor shots. Even in daylight, both contrast and color saturation levels are lower than with Instax film. Admittedly, this gave my pictures a more dreamy, vintage look that felt artistic, and you can use the Polaroid Lab to slightly adjust the saturation and exposure settings. However, doing so is time-consuming. \nTruth be told, you could argue that many of these shortcomings are typical of a retro Polaroid-inspired instant camera and, thus, part of the experience. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Polaroid Flip is the perfect camera for you.\nThe best instant camera for portability\nPolaroid Go (second-gen)\n\n\nScore: 7\n\nProsCons\n\n\nTiny and lightweight\nPrints vintage-like photos just like the Polaroid Flip\nUSB-C charging\n\nStruggles in low light\nFilm takes up to 15 minutes to develop\nNo Bluetooth support or companion app\n\n\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $89.99 $79.99 at Amazon\n $89.99 at Best Buy \n $89.99 at Polaroid\n\nFilm type: Polaroid i-Type Color Film (sold separately) / Film size: 2.6 x 2.1-inch prints / Weight: 239 grams / Charging method: USB-C / Companion app: No / Other features: Self-timer, selfie mirror, film counter\nWhereas the Polaroid Flip is huge, the second-gen Polaroid Go is tiny. It fits easily in the palm of my hand — which is saying a lot, given I’m petite and a little over five feet tall — making it the most portable instant camera on our list. It also produces the smallest prints of all the instant cameras I tested, which could be nice if you’re trying to save some space and want something more compact than Instax Mini prints.\nWeighing just over a pound, the latest Polaroid Go is also the lightest instant camera I’ve ever held, and you can easily use it with one hand. That’s actually pretty convenient, given I sometimes struggled to take pictures with the heavier Polaroid Flip and, to a lesser extent, some of the other instant cameras I tested. In fact, if the images produced looked more true-to-life and didn’t require you to hide them from light for about 15 minutes while developing, I’d be tempted to call this the best instant camera for travel or small children.\nAt $89.99, the latest Polaroid Go is the most affordable Polaroid camera on the market, even with its recent $10 price increase. Its film also costs just a little more than Fujifilm’s Instax Mini shots (or about $21.99 for a 16-sheet pack). The camera also sports a few upgrades over the last-gen model, despite retailing for less. The most significant is USB-C support, which allows for faster charging and prevents you from having to buy AA batteries.\nPolaroid also claims the camera produces clearer stills than its predecessor, but, truthfully, I didn’t see a significant difference between generations. The photos are a little brighter, but if anything, the original Polaroid Go produced warmer pictures that I thought were truer to life. Still, the photos are charming in the way only a Polaroid photo can be. Contrast and color saturation levels are still low, but in a way that exudes the vintage, almost dreamy look of the photos taken with the Flip.\nUnlike the Flip, however, the Go lacks creative modes and more advanced features, although it does offer a helpful self-timer and a larger selfie mirror. There’s also no Bluetooth support and, thus, no fancy app that will allow you to add extra effects. Instead, it’s just a simple point-and-shoot camera, just like the Instax Mini 12, which makes it a little easier to use. In addition, as mentioned, the prints are smaller than those of the Instax Mini, which could be a drawback for those who prefer larger, more traditional Polaroid photos. While it produces similar vintage-style shots, design-wise, it doesn’t look anything like old-school Polaroid cameras, which could also take away from the retro experience some desire.\nThat said, none of the older Polaroid cameras came with an app, either. All in all, the Go’s simplicity makes it a suitable candidate for those seeking an easy-to-use camera that offers a more traditional instant film experience — one you can use just about anywhere for less than half the price of the Polaroid Flip.\nOther instant cameras to consider\nInstax Mini 41\nIn April, Fujifilm announced the $116.95 Instax Mini 41, the long-awaited follow-up to the Mini 40. The updated model retains the retro design found on the prior model but introduces parallax correction, a feature borrowed from the Instax Mini 12 to help users avoid off-center shots when taking close-ups.\nIt didn’t take long testing the Mini 41 for me to realize it’s simply the Mini 12 for adults. With its black-and-silver body and flatter, squarer edges, the Mini 41 looks sleeker and more stylish. The two cameras are nearly identical, aside from the design, with the same solid photo quality and feature set. Both battery-powered options turn on with a simple twist of the lens, and each comes equipped with a selfie mirror, a close-up mode, and a flash (which cannot be disabled).\nThere are a few subtle upgrades to the Mini 41, however. A textured grip in the front makes it easier to hold, and its shape makes shooting in landscape mode more comfortable. But those are small differences, and at their core, the cameras offer the same experience. Since the Instax Mini 12 retails for less, I ultimately believe it’s the better value; however, if a fashionable, mature look appeals to you, the Mini 41 is a great alternative, especially if you can find it on sale.\nInstax Mini 99\nIf you’re looking for an advanced analog instant camera, Fujifilm’s Instax Mini 99 is one to consider. At $234.95, Fujifilm’s latest instant camera is not as affordable as the Instax Mini 12 or the Mini 41, but it’s certainly a step up from the one-button point-and-click cameras given it has multiple brightness settings, focus zones, color effects, and even two shutter buttons for greater creative control. The camera even comes with a tripod socket, an aluminum extension column, and a Sports Mode designed to further reduce blur when capturing fast-moving subjects.\nThanks to the added level of customization, I was able to capture higher-quality photos that looked truer to life than those from the Instax Mini 12, Mini 41, and Mini Evo. Granted, the Mini 99 is an analog camera, not a hybrid like the Evo, so you shouldn’t buy it if you also want to print smartphone photos. The newer model is also less user-friendly than the Mini 12 and Mini 41, so I wouldn’t recommend it for young children. Still, for an advanced analog instant camera, it’s relatively easy to set up and use, rendering it as much fun for budding photographers as more experienced shooters. \nKodak Smile Plus\nThe Kodak Smile Plus is another hybrid instant camera that allows you to print smartphone photos. It’s smaller and less expensive than Kodak’s Mini Shot 3 Retro 3 at $129.99, and it’s available in a variety of vibrant colors that should appeal to children. It also comes with a physical filter-changing lens and prints on Zinc paper, allowing you to use your photos as stickers. \nHowever, it lacks a built-in display, so you can’t choose which images you want to print directly on the camera itself. This often results in more wasted shots, especially since image quality is so-so at best, even when compared to those of the Retro 3. Photos are nowhere near as clear as the Instax Mini 12’s, either, especially in areas that are either too bright or too dark. \nThat said, the Smile Plus does offer a microSD card slot, so you can store and view photos elsewhere. It pairs with an app similar to the Retro 3’s as well, and although the software isn’t as snappy or feature-rich, it still lets you add a variety of filters and frames. Ultimately, I’d recommend the Retro 3 since it’s often available for less than $120, but the Smile Plus is a good, budget-friendly alternative.\nLeica Sofort 2\nFrom photo quality to the lever you pull to print photos, Leica’s Sofort 2 is a terrific camera that’s remarkably similar to the Instax Mini Evo. In all of my tests, the photos I took with both looked identical. The two hybrid cameras also print smartphone photos via Instax Mini film and offer 10 film and lens effects, along with a macro mode for those who want more creative control. The Sofort 2’s minimalistic look is stylish, too, even if it’s not as charming as the retro-inspired Evo.\nThe drawback to the Sofort 2 is that it’s twice the price of the Evo. It’s challenging to recommend at $399, as most people would likely consider the differences between the two cameras relatively minor. The Leica user interface is easier to navigate, though, and I appreciate the included lens cap and extended two-year warranty. I also appreciate that it lets you print photos taken with other Leica cameras via the companion app — a nice perk for Leica fans. Nonetheless, I don’t think those perks are enough to justify spending nearly $200 more.\nInstax Square SQ1\nWhile it didn’t make the cut, the Instax Square SQ1 is also worth a brief mention. Like the Mini 12, the Square SQ1 produces good-quality shots, is easy to set up and use, and features a built-in selfie mirror. The reason we didn’t include it above, however, is that it costs nearly twice as much as the Mini 12 at $159.95, though we do sometimes see it on sale for $100.\nThat said, it might be worth a look if you prefer large 2.4 x 2.4-inch square prints and relatively true-to-life photos over vintage-looking stills. After all, the SQ1 is still cheaper than the Polaroid Flip and produces higher-quality images than the Kodak Mini Shot 3 Square Retro, which also prints similarly sized square shots.\nFujifilm also sells the newer Instax Square SQ40. It’s similar to the Instax Square SQ1 but with a vintage look that’s more visually striking, yet it’s also more expensive at $199.95. Given it produces similarly good-quality photos, I’d recommend the Instax Square SQ1 or the more capable Instax Mini Evo for $50 more.\nInstax Wide Evo Hybrid\nFujifilm’s Instax Wide Evo Hybrid is nearly identical to the Instax Mini Evo. You can use it to print photos directly from your smartphone, though the $409.95 camera also comes with a 15.67mm lens — the widest used on any Instax camera — for taking wide-format pictures. \nUltimately, I preferred the smaller, more travel-friendly Mini Evo, but if you’re into wide prints (and don’t mind spending twice as much), the Wide Evo Hybrid is rather fun. The photo quality is solid and on par with both the Instax Mini Evo and Instax Mini 12. The main difference is that the Wide Evo’s lens captures a broader field of view. It also offers a few additional lenses and film effects, giving users a bit more creative control. I especially liked the Degree Control feature, which lets you fine-tune the intensity of each lens effect applied to your image.\nPlus, unlike the Wide 400, the Wide Evo Hybrid is a hybrid camera with an LCD screen — a helpful feature that can reduce wasted shots. However, at $409.95, it costs significantly more than both the Mini Evo and the Wide 400. My other main complaint is that there’s a slight delay between pressing the shutter and the photo being taken — something I didn’t notice with the Mini Evo. It’s not a dealbreaker, but it can be frustrating when trying to capture fast-moving subjects, such as a dog or hyperactive toddler.\nInstax Wide 400\nIf you’re into wide-format instant cameras but don’t want to spend $409.95 — or prefer a more traditional analog experience — the $175.95 Instax Wide 400 is a solid pick. The basic point-and-shoot produces similar stills to the Wide Evo, and in some ways, it’s easier to use, thanks to its stripped-down feature set. That simplicity, however, comes at the cost of customization, making it harder to capture the perfect shot. It also swaps an LCD display for a large viewfinder and is noticeably heavier than the Instax Mini Evo. Nonetheless, if you’re after wide prints at a more affordable price, it’s a worthwhile option.\nFujifilm Instax Mini LiPlay Plus\nFujifilm’s new Instax Mini LiPlay Plus isn’t nearly as stylish as the Instax Mini Evo, but it’s worth considering if you take a lot of selfies. At $234.99, the hybrid camera costs the same as the Instax Mini Evo, but features a 3-inch LCD screen on the back, along with a second, rear-facing wide-angle lens designed specifically for self-portraits. That dedicated selfie camera, paired with the LCD, delivers some of the best — and most precise — selfies I’ve captured with an instant camera to date.\nThe LiPlay Plus also includes some fun extra features, such as a layered photo mode that combines images from both cameras into a single shot. It can also record short audio clips, which are saved as a QR code you can place in a corner of the printed photo. Both features are enjoyable to play with, though the layered photo mode can, admittedly, come off as gimmicky. You’re basically just dropping a selfie onto a background image with no way to reposition or resize it.\nWhat’s coming next\nEarlier this year, Fujifilm announced the vintage-inspired Instax Mini Evo Cinema, a $409.95 hybrid camera that can capture 15-second video clips. The unique instant camera features what Fujifilm calls an Eras Dial, which lets you choose from 10 built-in effects inspired by different decades, ranging from the 1930s to the 2020s. Some effects even add sound while you shoot, letting you add “distinctive sound characteristics,” such as a mechanical film shutter, to your recordings. You can also turn frames into movie poster-style prints or share your videos on social media. It will launch in Japan on January 30th, before becoming more widely available in the US in early February.\nThe $79.99 Kodak Printomatic Plus is a basic point-and-shoot instant camera with a 10-megapixel sensor that prints 2 × 3-inch photos. It’s notable for its low price point and for being ready to use out of the box (it comes with a five-print starter pack of film). I’ll be testing the camera soon and will share my thoughts once I’ve spent some time with it, including whether it holds up as a decent alternative to the Instax Mini 12.\nUpdate, January 23rd: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, added the new Instax Mini LiPlus, and mentioned the Instax Mini Evo Cinema and Kodak Printomatic Plus.",

      "description": "The AirPods Pro 3 are Apple’s best noise-canceling earbuds.\t\n\nIf you’re considering gifting the AirPods Pro 3 for Valentine’s Day, now’s a great time to pick them up. Today only, Best Buy is selling the noise-canceling earbuds for $199.99 ($50 off), matching their all-time low.\nAirPods Pro 3\n\nWhere to Buy:\n\n $249.99 $199.99 at Best Buy\n $249 $239.95 at Amazon\n\nFor iPhone owners, nothing else really compares to the AirPods Pro 3. They deliver the best active noise cancellation and richest sound of any Apple wireless earbuds to date, combined with a more comfortable, angled design that fits securely and naturally in your ear canal. The AirPods Pro 3 also feature a new XXS ear tip size and a more robust IP57 sweat and water resistance rating, making them better suited for workouts.\nThe earbuds pull double duty as well, functioning as a fitness tracker thanks to a built-in heart rate sensor that works with Apple’s Fitness app to track calories burned across more than 50 workout types. They even support real-time live translation, making them especially useful for travel. And, as you’d expect, they play well with other Apple devices, offering conveniences like automatic device switching and a case with Find My capabilities.\nRead our AirPods Pro 3 review.\nThree more ways to save:\nWith the Switch 2 upgrade for the game expected to arrive on March 26th, now is a great time to grab a copy of Super Mario Bros. for $46.99 ($13 off) at Woot, which is its best price to date. The side-scrolling game builds on the best of classic Mario Bros. games, adding fun, bizarre new elements, surprising twists, and levels that test everything from combat skills to speed. Read our review.\nNow through January 23, Woot is selling the Amazon Smart Thermostat in refurbished condition for $39.99, which is $40 less than buying it new. In her review, The Verge’s Jennifer Pattison Tuohy was impressed by how capable the budget thermostat is for the price. It delivers features usually reserved for models that cost more than twice as much, notably the ability to adapt to your habits and preferences. The attractive thermostat integrates well with Amazon Alexa too and while it doesn’t come with native temperature sensors, it’s a good investment to make if you’re embedded in Amazon’s ecosystem. Read our review.\nAmazon is selling the Anker Nano II 30W for $9.99 ($14 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen on the charger. It features a single USB-C port that can deliver up to 30 watts of power, making it capable of quickly charging a laptop, smartphone, tablet, and other devices. While its prongs don’t fold, the charger is still small enough to easily slip into a bag.",
